Email spam detection with machine learning

We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this Project,I have used Python to build an email spam detector. Then,I have used machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
